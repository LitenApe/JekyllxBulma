This is an example of how a post picture can look like, the apperance can be easily changed by
changing the **.has-photo** class in the the **jekyllxbulma.css** file  

If you want to reduce the height of the pictures, I would recommend you to wrap
img tag inside a div for full control of the img behavior.
